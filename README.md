## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Details

The subscription form uses a hidden iframe technique to submit data to Google Sheets without redirecting the user or causing CORS issues. This approach:

1. Targets form submission to a hidden iframe instead of the main window
2. Provides a seamless user experience with success feedback 
3. Avoids common redirect issues with Google Script web apps

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Clone this repository**

2. **Setup configuration**
   - Copy `config.example.json` to `config.json`
   - Edit with your own values:
     ```json
     {
       "googleScriptUrl": "YOUR_GOOGLE_SCRIPT_URL_HERE",
       "sourceDomain": "YOUR_DOMAIN_HERE"
     }
     ```

3. **Set up Google Apps Script**
   - Create a Google Sheet to store subscriber data
   - Go to Extensions > Apps Script
   - Copy the code from `improved-google-script.js` into the Apps Script editor
   - Update the `SPREADSHEET_ID` in the script with your Sheet's ID
   - Deploy as a web app with "Anyone, even anonymous" access
   - Copy the Web App URL into your `config.json` file

4. **Deploy to your web server**
   - Upload all files to your hosting provider
